  "The LCG sequence, pinned, so that both hosts produce the same one.

  `yield.monte-carlo` is `.cljc` -- a claim that it runs on ClojureScript --
  and until 2026-08-25 its PRNG was written in JVM terms only: `unchecked-*`
  on `long` for the u64 wraparound, and `(bit-shift-left 1 53)` for the
  divisor. ClojureScript has neither. Measured that day under nbb:

    one LCG step from 12345  =>  7.856670437842954e+22, a float; nothing
                                 wrapped (the JVM gives -1206486762903477482)
    (bit-shift-left 1 53)    =>  2097152, not 2^53

  so `lcg-next-f64`, documented to return a value in `[0,1)`, returned values
  in the billions -- and every distribution in the file is built on it.

  There was no ClojureScript runner here either, so nothing had ever asked
  (root ADR-2608730000).

  The pinned numbers below are the JVM's, taken before any of this was
  touched. They are the point: a parity test that computes both sides with
  the same code proves only that the code is deterministic."
