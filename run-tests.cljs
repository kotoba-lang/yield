  "The portable suites in this repository, run under nbb.

   `yield.monte-carlo` is `.cljc`, which claims ClojureScript. Until
   2026-08-25 there was no ClojureScript runner here, so nothing had ever
   executed that claim -- root ADR-2608730000. What it hid was a 64-bit LCG
   written in JVM terms: on this runtime nothing wrapped, and a function
   documented to return `[0,1)` returned values in the billions.

   Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below; being
   required is not being run.

  "namespace -> why it is not in the list above.

   `yield-test` requires the top-level `yield` namespace, and a namespace
   named exactly `yield` cannot be loaded on this runtime: `yield` is a
   reserved JavaScript word.

   Measured 2026-08-25 by construction rather than by argument. Four
   single-segment namespaces, same classpath, same command:

     harvest  loads      yield2  loads
     yield    Could not find namespace
     await    Could not find namespace   (also a reserved word)

   `yield.corner`, `yield.aging` and `yield.monte-carlo` all load -- it is the
   bare name, not the prefix. Renaming the namespace is a real decision (the
   repository is called `yield`) and not one to take in passing, so the suite
   that needs it stays out and says why."
  '{yield-test "requires the `yield` namespace; `yield` is a reserved JavaScript word"})

;; The exclusion's reason, re-checked every run, so it retires itself if the
;; namespace is ever renamed. `require` returns a PROMISE under nbb -- a version
;; that wrapped it in `try` and printed on the next line would report a stale
;; exclusion on every run, having waited for nothing.
